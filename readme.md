#Firebase Playaround
Small demo to discover Google Firebase API

###How to install:
1) Install all dependencies `npm i`
2) Type `npm run start` in console to run nodemon local server
3) Check webpage `http://localhost:3000/new` and copy token into clipboard
4) Paste code into `const token = ...` in `index.html`
5) Open `index.html` in browser and discover some little magic

FYI: I know, better approach is direct request from webpage to localhost server. I'll fix it, or propose PR to this repo.
